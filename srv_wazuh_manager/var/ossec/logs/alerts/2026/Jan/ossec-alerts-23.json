Protection from resource exhaustion The default installation only creates a single / partition.

In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection from exploitation An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated.

Protection from resource exhaustion The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var/tmp directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var/tmp and cause potential disruption to daemons as the disk is full. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /var/tmp as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection from exploitation An example of exploiting /var/tmp may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.","remediation":"For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/tmp.
